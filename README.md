If you've found it, then you know why you need it.

There is no main required file in the source code, but it is available in the release.\
I think if you need it when using the source code, then you will find it yourself.

The purpose of the program is convenient management. The following functionality is available:
- search
- delete
- add
- clear cache

The project was made for myself and I will update the releases as needed.
